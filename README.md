# coffee-machine-day-15-100daysofpython
I just entered the intermediate territory of the 100 Days with Python course and I believe that from now on every day will require a new repository. This day we installed a new IDE, I've
been using VS Code, but the teacher recommended PyCharm, I've installed to see which one I'll find better.

The project for this day is to crate a "Coffee Machine", I've put the "requirements" pdf inside the folder!
